/*You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a 
 * method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class 
 * called MyCalculator which implements the interface.
divisor_Sum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12.
